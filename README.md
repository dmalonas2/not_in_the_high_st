Client order tracking and checkout backend Spring app, that is responsible for applying different types of discount


## Testing
Testing implemented using unit tests and by manually testing the api (in the API directory)


## Types of Discounts
* Quantity-based  (e.g. discount for buying X or more B items)
* Threshold-based (e.g. discount for buying products that in total (and after the quantity-based discount has been applied) cost more than an Admin defined value)
* ...potential to add more complex discount bundles
